# Factom Interoperability Specifications (FIS) :gear:

This is the central location for collaboration on data and interoperability aspects for parties working with and implementing on top of the Factom &reg; Protocol
project. It is not about enforcing implementors to implement solutions. It is about voluntary specifications implementors can adhere to on top of the Factom &reg; Protocol to make sure they are interoperable with other solutions and products in the same domain that have a Factom &reg; integration.
Examples are for instance signing data using Factom native identities and DIDs.



# How Does FIS Work?

See our primary document, [FIS-X](FIS/x.md)  the initial standard that
defines the FIS process.

# What is the relationship to the Factom Improvment Proposals (FIP)?

FIP is about changes and improvements for the Factom &reg; Protocol, APIs, core software and native language drivers. FIS however is about specification, changes and improvements for 2nd layer solutions. So software and data on top of the Factom &reg; Protocol.

# Contributing

[FIS-X](FIS/x.md) is the initial standard that describes the core framework,
conventions and guidelines for creating FIS standards for
submission. Create your submission in a markdown file following the guidelines
defined in FIS-X and the [FIS Template](FIS/template.md)

To submit your specification, fork this repo and then submit a pull request to have
it reviewed and included for evaluation by the community.
